# Kubernetes Kraken

Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts,
providing basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes is:

* **lean**: lightweight, simple, accessible
* **portable**: public, private, hybrid, multi cloud
* **extensible**: modular, pluggable, hookable, composable
* **self-healing**: auto-placement, auto-restart, auto-replication

Kubernetes builds upon a decade and a half of experience at Google running production workloads at scale, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.
